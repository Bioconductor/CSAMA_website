### Should I pay VAT? {#VAT}

Due to Italian regulation (DPR 663/72 art.7) and EU fiscal regulations, the total cost for the participant attending this course has to include VAT (IVA in italian) of 22%. This rule applies to all “entities”: profit and non-profit companies and/or institutions and citizens even when special fiscal treatments exist in the original country of the “entity” unless your company or institution is registered into the VIES system.

**Please note:** if you pay on behalf of your organization as a private citizen, i.e. from your personal bank account, then you have to add VAT anyway even if your organization is registered into the VIES system (as VAT is calculated for the actual “payer/buyer”). In this case it is better to ask us before paying.

To know about your VIES status, please follow the steps below:
