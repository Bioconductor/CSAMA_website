# By Airplane

Several airports have good train connections to Bressanone:

- Bolzano, Italy (BZO) 50 km (30 minutes by train)
- Innsbruck, Austria (INN) 80 km (1 hours by train)
- Verona, Italy (Valerio Catullo, VRN) 200 km

- Milano-Malpensa, Italy (MXP) 350 km

The closest large airport is Verona (Valerio Catullo) international airport. From Verona airport to the railway station Verona P.ta Nuova (see above) there are shuttle busses every 20 minutes from 6:30am to 11:35pm. From Verona to Bressanone it takes about 2 hours by train, and you have several trains per day (see above).

About Munich: please do not confuse Munich’s main airport (Franz-Josef Strauss) with Ryanair’s “Munich West” (Memmingen) – it is far out in the Allgäu, and it is not much fun coming from there by public transport; with a rental car, it may however be an option.
