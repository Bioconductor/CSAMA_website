# By Airplane

Several airports have good train connections to Bressanone:

- Bolzano, Italy (BZO) 50 km (30 minutes by train)
- Innsbruck, Austria (INN) 80 km (1 hours by train)
- Verona, Italy (Valerio Catullo, VRN) 200 km
- Munich, Germany (Franz-Josef Strauss, MUC) 260 km
- Venezia, Italy (Marco Polo, VCE) 320 km
- Milano-Linate, Italy (LIN) 330 km
- Milano-Malpensa, Italy (MXP) 350 km

The closest large airport is Verona (Valerio Catullo) international airport. From Verona airport to the railway station Verona P.ta Nuova (see above) there is a [frequent shuttle bus service](https://www.atv.verona.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/EN/IDPagina/90) throughout the day. From Verona to Bressanone it takes about 2 hours by train, and you have several trains per day (see above).

About Munich: please do not confuse Munich’s main airport (Franz-Josef Strauss) with what Ryanair calls “Munich West” (Memmingen) – the latter is far out in the Allg&auml;u, and it is not much fun coming from there by public transport; with a rental car, it is an option.

# Hotel information

You need to make your booking directly. There are many hotels and holiday rental options in Brixen, check the usual websites (booking, tripadvisor, airbnb, fewo-direct, ...). Many of the course organisers and participants will be in the following places, which are short walking distance from the course venue and Brixen downtown (in general, Brixen is very compact and walkable):

 - Hotel Gruener Baum (Albero Verde)
 - Hotel Goldene Krone
 - Hotel Elephant

### Other accommodation
There also exist two youth hostel-like accommodations. These locations have low fares, and they can be considered as equivalent both for quality and location (Brixen is a small town). Please ask directly them if you need rooms (with or without bath, etc).
