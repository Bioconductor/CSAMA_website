## Lecture and Lab topics

*Biological domains*

- RNA-Seq from sequences to analysis: mapping, quantification at gene and transcript level, gamma-Poisson distribution
- Single cell (droplet based) RNA-seq: exploratory analysis, quality assessment, dimension reduction
- Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics
- Image-based data and spatial omics (CODEX, MERFISH et al.)
- Emerging topics and participant suggestions

*Statistics and data science*

- Introduction to the Bioconductor project (community, infrastructure, data structures, annotation resources)
- Visualization, including interactivity, PCA and other low-dimensional embeddings, clustering, distances, nearest-neighbour graphs
- Statistical hypothesis testing, false discovery rate, multiple testing, filtering and weighting
- Regression: experimental design and design matrices, power, identifiability, diagnostics, generalized linear models
- Classification / supervised machine learning, multi-omic data integration methods
- Data manipulation, EDA, and tidy data analysis, applied to high dimensional biological data
- Reproducibility, best practices for computational research, method comparison, benchmarking
- Emerging topics and participant suggestions
