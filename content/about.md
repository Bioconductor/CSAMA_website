The one-week intensive course **Statistical Data Analysis for Genome-Scale Biology** teaches statistical and computational data analysis of multi-omics studies in biology and biomedicine. It comprises lectures covering underlying theory and state of the art, and practical hands-on exercises based on the R / Bioconductor environment. At the end of the course, you should be able to run analysis workflows on your own (multi-)omic data, adapt and combine different tools, and make informed and scientifically sound choices about analysis strategies.

The course is intended for researchers who have basic familiarity with the experimental technologies and their applications in biology, and who are interested in making the step from a user of bioinformatics software towards adapting or developing their own analysis workflows. The four practical sessions of the course will require you to follow and modify scripts in the computer language R. To freshen up your R skills, see below for some links.

## Topics

- Introduction to R and Bioconductor

## Computer Tutorials

You will work on the labs at your own pace in small groups with expert guidance (all lecturers from the morning sessions plus teaching assistants).

Participants are required to bring their own laptop with the most recent release versions of R and Bioconductor installed: R-3.6.x and Bioconductor 3.9 installed (details will be provided). Please make sure that your computer’s hardware is sufficiently powered (>=8 GB RAM, >20 GB free disk space) and that you have administrator rights. The course material will be provided by a local network wireless network – however, this not connected to the internet. Please set up your computer beforehand; internet connections at the course venue can be slow and unreliable.
