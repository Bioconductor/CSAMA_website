Please see the [CSAMA 2023 Programme](https://csama2023.bioconductor.eu/programme/) for a previous example of the structure and content.

## Tentative Lecture and Lab topics

- RNA-Seq from raw data to DESeq2: mapping, quantification at gene and transcript level, gamma-Poisson model, DESeq2
- Single cell (droplet based) RNA-seq: exploratory analysis, quality assessment, dimension reduction (incl., t-SNE, UMAP) 
- Visualisation / graphics, PCA and other low-dimensional embeddings, Clustering, distances, nearest-neighbour graphs (with sc-RNA-Seq examples)
- Statistical hypothesis testing, false discovery rate, multiple testing, filtering and weighting
- Regression: more on design matrices, power, identifiability, diagnostics, generalized linear models for count data
- Classification / supervised machine learning
- Image-based data and Spatial omics (CODEX, MERFISH et al.)
- Introduction to the Bioconductor project (community, organisational structure, website, important infrastructure packages, data structures, annotation resources) <!-- Lori Kern -->
- Immunobioinformatics  <!-- Katharina Imkeller -->
- Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics <!-- Laurent Gatto, Johannes Rainer --> 
- Emerging topics and participant suggestions
