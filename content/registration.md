Places are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In the last years, the course was sold out. We aim to finalize registration by 14 June 2019.

### Before paying:

If you are unsure about the VAT, please check the section “Should I pay VAT?” below or ask us at csama@voices-int.com.
If you are unsure about which category you belong to, if you need to pay by money transfer, if you need an invoice for your institution, or for any other need, please contact us at csama@voices-int.com.
Registration, on-site logistics and other local assistance will be handled by VOICES from the Blogs, a Spinoff Company of the University of Milan.

**NOTE:** If you pay through PayPal from your personal bank account you must pay the 22% additional VAT. If your institution is European and pays directly through PayPal or money transfer the registration is VAT exempt. For other information about VAT please go the “Should I pay the VAT” section.

Italian participants payed by Italian institutions (PA) or private companies, should ask for the “fattura elettronica” unless they pay on a personal basis.
