Two items for the https://eurobioc2022.bioconductor.org/ website:
1) Publicly available speaker information is limited. Inviters, please, ask for short bios (<150 words).
2) We need names and photos of all on the organizing committee. They will be arranged in alphabetical order, changing it later will be difficult. Please, add your photo to the Google Drive folder before Oct 27.


"?" - Are those individuals on the committee?
"+" - photo present in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Z31ZWQY2inyvXgZN94i535oFln7OzcU2
"-" - photo available from previous meetings or Google
